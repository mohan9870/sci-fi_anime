  // If #root is the flex container, then apply this to #root instead of body.
  // In a Create React App, #root is the typical place where the App component is mounted.
  // So, ensure either body or #root (or both) are set as flex column containers.
  // For most React apps, applying `display: flex; flex-direction: column;` to `#root` is more common
  // and reliable because the `App` component is directly rendered inside `#root`.
  // Let's assume you'll apply it to #root via an .app-container class as suggested previously.
